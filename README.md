# Data_Structure_And_Algo
Some of the basic concept's and algorithm implementations.
In this repository i will add all the basic problems and best solutins interms of space and time. As a Computer Scientest it is our duty to develope an efficent Algorithm with 
minimum time complexity and it should occupy less space. We have to take good care of time factor because time is precious.
Code Along with baisic concepts and I will also add the lecture notes and my personal notes.

# Assignment003
Polynomail Calculator was our Data structures assignment where we implemented our knowledge of linked list to make it possible. Using a singly Linked List
we developed the calculator ,main concepts were Operator overloading ,insertion ,deletion , sorting the poly and Operation with polynomial like add and multiply.

# Assignment04
This was quite interesting assignment where we have to convert an infix expression to postfix , then we have to convert the same expresion into prefix and at last we have evaluate the given expression. Basically Normally Humans ca read infix notation quite easily and they can work comfortably with them . We can recognise the braces precedences while solving the equations but computers are not Intelligent like you ;) but they are way faster then you that's what's make computers genuises. So to make the computer understand we convert the exprerssion into post and prefixes because we get rid of the parenthesis and It is easy for the computer to operate on it. 
So for this peurpose we can use the stack data structure. Basically stacks follow the "FILO" Rule. what ever goes in first will be the last to comeout. By using stack we will make calculator which will convert and evaluate a given infix expression into postfix and prefix. Hope you will enjoy
