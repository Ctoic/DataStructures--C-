# Data_Structure_And_Algo
Some of the basic concept's and algorithm implementations.
In this repository i will add all the basic problems and best solutins interms of space and time. As a Computer Scientest it is our duty to develope an efficent Algorithm with 
minimum time complexity and it should occupy less space. We have to take good care of time factor because time is precious.
Code Along with baisic concepts and I will also add the lecture notes and my personal notes.

#Assignment003
Polynomail Calculator was our Data structures assignment where we implemented our knowledge of linked list to make it possible. Using a singly Linked List
we developed the calculator ,main concepts were Operator overloading ,insertion ,deletion , sorting the poly and Operation with polynomial like add and multiply.
